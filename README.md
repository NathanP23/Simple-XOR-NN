# Simple XOR Neural Network

This project implements a simple neural network to solve the XOR logic problem using Python.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NathanP23/Simple-XOR-NN.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
    cd Simple-XOR-NN

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install numpy

## Usage

To train the neural network and observe its learning process:

1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py

Epoch (i.e. iteration of the model to fine-tune weights and biases) is set to 5000
as Epoch go up - Loss (i.e. the difference between the excpected output and the output) is approaching 0

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `neural_network.py`: This file contains the implementation of the NeuralNetwork class responsible for building and training the neural network.
- `main.py`: This script demonstrates how to utilize the NeuralNetwork class to solve the XOR logic problem by training the network.
- `README.md`: This file provides information about the project, installation steps, usage instructions, and project structure (you're reading it!).
- `LICENSE`: The project's license file, specifying permissions and limitations for using the code.
